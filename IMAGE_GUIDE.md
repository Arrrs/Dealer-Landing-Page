   - Target: <200KB for hero images, <100KB for section images

2. **Provide WebP versions** when possible for better performance
   - Name convention: `filename.webp` alongside `filename.png`

3. **Use appropriate formats:**
   - Photos: JPG or WebP
   - Graphics with transparency: PNG
   - Large backgrounds: JPG with quality 75-85%

4. **Responsive considerations:**
   - Provide 2x versions for retina displays if image is hero/above fold
   - Example: `hero-image.png` (800px) and `hero-image@2x.png` (1600px)
